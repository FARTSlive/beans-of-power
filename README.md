## Description

*Rage game*.

You have had some magic beans. Now you have power. Too much power.

You are trying really hard to hold that power so you cant even walk like a human. All you can do is roll.

**Use A/D or Left/Right to roll in desired direction**.

You can only hold it for so long though.
At some point it is going to be too much power and some of it will have to be released, resulting in an auto jump.

**You can also press W/Up/Space to force a jump**. This, same as auto jump, releases some of the power.
